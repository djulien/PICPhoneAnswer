*Important note for audio files. Careful read notes below will save you a lot of precious time!
- DFPlayer Mini read both MP3 and WAV files.
- All audio files must be placed under /mp3 folder.
- Audio file must be named 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3.....0255.mp3 (4 letters not 2 or 3 letters)
- Audio file names can have any characters after 4 digits, such as 0001_Bruno_Mars_Count_On Me.mp3 
- Tested few under 1 second WAV files and they did not work
- If one of the audio file is removed from SD cared, DFPlayer still can find it and play it! Weird! In the end, I formatted the SD card to make DFPlayer to play the music I specified.
- Delay(seconds); You have to specify number of seconds delay for the audio file to play completely or the next audio file might be started before current audio is over!
- mp3_play (74); means play audio file 0074.mp3
